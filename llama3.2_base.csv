Get yourself an honest mechanic and don't trust this place even for recall work. NEVER AGAIN.,6.0,"Dennis, we are very sorry to hear about your experience with our Service Department.   Be assured that we will not ever intentionally create problems with a customer's vehicle for the purpose of selling unnecessary items or work.   We are an extremely busy service department that receives more work on a daily basis than we can sometimes handle quickly.  Consequently, we do not need to create unnecessary work - there is more than enough demand for legitimate repairs.  Recalls are important repairs that we often prioritize for the safety of our customers.  Our goal is to try to repair recalls and inspect for any other repair issues at that time.   A vehicle that is older with high mileage such as your vehicle might require additional repairs.  I cannot possibly confirm the problem you had with your vehicle because you did not give us the opportunity to check the problem to see if it stemmed from the work that was done or was unrelated.  I would like to know if our technician possibly made a mistake that caused the issue.  But without being given that opportunity it is impossible for us to know what happened.  Regardless, we are sorry you did not have a good experience and assure you that we will never sabotage a vehicle to create unnecessary work.  Please contact Anthony, our service manager at (718)657-5222, if you have any further concerns.",I went in for recall work on door handles on my SUV.

It was dangerous to drive with the issue I was having. I went early morning, took risk to drive there.

I was first curtly told I did not have appt and that I had to come back some other day. Upon explaining the situation that car was dangerous to drive, the front desk man was still refusing.  I insisted just to take a quick look by a mechanic so at least I knew what to do, I  was then taken in.

I waited in the visitor room patiently for four plus hours, the whole time without uttering a word. After four long hours, the guy who had checked me in, came by and reassured me that I was very close and next in queue.

Another two plus hours, that is after a whopping six plus hours literally no exaggeration, the same man came in and without any sense of apology or shame, thuggishly telling me to take my car away as I could not be attended to.

I kindly objected and politely in one short sentence about my six plus hours wait. This thug was giving me look and attitude as if he were ready to gang attack me, and as if it were my fault waiting so patiently and without much complaint.

We are sorry to hear of your disappointment with our service department during your recent visit at Ford Lincoln of Queens. This is a legitimate case of a warranty running out before a major repair was needed. As per our records, a pressure test was performed on the cooling system to check for leaks. This test resulted in none present. If the water pump leaked since your visit in December of 2018, it would have likely come in with an overheated engine. We have a great deal of respect for our customers and appreciate the passion they have for their vehicles. Please understand we take pride in the services we provide and we stand by the accuracy of our first diagnostic report in December of 2018.

In next couple months the problem got worse and any person with little knowledge about cars can tell the leak is coming from inside the engine. So when I came back to this service center 6 months later and told them about the problem I got charged 2300$!!!  Of course I don’t have the warranty anymore and they didn’t honor or took responsibility for not able to take care of the problem while I had warranty. Very good business ethics!!! Bravo 👏, but how long??","Product Quality, Service Cost, Staff Business Ethics",Negative,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I declined ofcourse took it home. Did some searching on the internet and found that the issue of going limp can be from a faulty filter or oil pressure switch. I purchased both parts for less than $30. I removed the intake assembly and chanrge pipes for driver side turbo. Pulled the pressure switch out using a 13/16 wrench and replaced it. Reassembled air intake and turbo pipes. Did a full oil change with high performance Fram filter. Then drove to New Jersey and back no issues with oil pressure and going limp.

The abs module was not looked at, the wheel speed sensor was not looked at, the crankshaft sensor was not looked at, etc. However they charged me $200, I would love to have my money back. Seems like after they found out I was paying out of pocket and it wasnt covered under warranty they didn't want to really look at it. I guess ill just take it to a mom and pop shop and have the crankshaft sensor replaced.
